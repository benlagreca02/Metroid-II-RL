# Metroid-II-RL

This is my attempt at having reinforcemnt learning algo play Metroid II

## TODO
lots to do...

- [ ] Make and verify a custom environment with PyBoy
    - [x] Verify ROM integrity
    - [x] Take random actions
    - [ ] Implement a `game_wrapper` for Metroid II (makes AI stuff easier)
        - [ ] Integrate and verify the RAM mappings 
    - [ ] Figure out all possible button input combos and implement them (We
      want to be able to jump and shoot, or aim up, run, and shoot at the same
      time possibly)

- [ ] Model
    - [ ] Research, research, research...
- [ ] Containerize the program to make running on other machines easy
